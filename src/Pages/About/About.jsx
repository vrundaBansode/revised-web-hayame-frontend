      <h1 className='about-us-header'>HAYAME - A Leading Recruitment & Manpower Web Based company in Malaysia</h1>

      <h2 className='about-us-title'>Our Story</h2>
      <p>HAYAME is a recruitment technology & manpower supply startup founded in 2023 by a group of HR professionals and developers to assist both employers and job seekers with their hiring needs.</p>
      <p>Our initial focus was to address the problem of time-consuming and inefficient recruitment processes, which our founder, Johannes Losgrandes, experienced himself when he was tasked with hiring for his company. We realized that many job seekers were also frustrated with the lack of transparency and ease in finding job opportunities. Passionate about making the hiring process more streamlined and accessible, we took matters into our own hands and decided to tackle the issues both employers and job seekers face for good.</p>
      <p>Since implementing our recruitment app in various industries, we have received overflowing support and positive feedback both from employers and job seekers. It wasn't long before we realized there was much to do for the recruitment industry in Malaysia after receiving numerous requests and demands from our users. We made it our mission to roll out more comprehensive features that would significantly impact the recruitment industry.</p>
      <p>Today, HAYAME serves as an all-in-one recruitment companion for both employers and job seekers. Employers can easily post job openings, manage applications, and conduct interviews through our app, while job seekers can search for job opportunities and apply directly through the platform. Additionally, we offer a range of tools such as resume builder and career advice to assist job seekers in their career development.</p>
      <p>We believe that the future of recruitment is digital, and we are committed to making the hiring process efficient, transparent, and accessible in collaboration with our partner companies.</p>
